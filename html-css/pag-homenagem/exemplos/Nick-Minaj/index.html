          She was first spotted by the CEO of Young Money, and was later
          recruited for The Carter Edition of Young Money's own "The Come Up"
          DVD series. Her rapping skills caught the eyes of Lil Wayne who later
          worked with her for many collaborations with his mixtapes.

          In April 2007, Minaj released her first mixtape "Playtime Is Over".
          One year later she made another mixtape "Sucka Free" which made her
          Female Artist of the Year at the Underground Music Awards. In 2009 she
          made her third mixtape "Beam Me Up Scotty" which got positive reviews
          from BET and MTV.

      <h3 id="rumours">Nicki Minaj Well Known Rumours</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>She Copied Lil' Kim</strong> When Nicki Minaj first broke out on
        the scene back in 2010 with her hit song 'Super Bass', she instantly
        skyrocketed to international success. As her career progressed, she was
        being compared more and more to rap iconic, Lil' Kim, and has been
        accused of copying her well throughout her career, which we are certain
        Nicki has had enough of.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Her Hatred For Mariah Carey</strong> Nicki Minaj has been
        accused of not getting along with a number of people in the industry,
        and one of those people is with the legendary Mariah Carey. Nicki and
        Mariah both worked on Season 12 of 'American Idol' together, and had a
        huge blow up on the show, however, Nicki made it clear that they do not
        hate one another, and simply had a tiff that was blown out of proportion
        by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Huge Feud With Cardi B</strong> It appears Nicki Minaj has been
        pitted against a number of other female artists in the industry. In
        addition to Mariah Carey and Lil' Kim, Nicki has also been accused of
        having it out for Cardi B. Now the two may not be friends, but they
        certainly do not hate one another. Nicki declared there is "nothing but
        love", between the two and they both wish the other nothing but success.
